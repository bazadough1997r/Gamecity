# Gamecity
Gamesity is a community building games-based platform, designed to bring people from different places to play and have fun.
Creating a new social media where a user (which is a player) signs up, starts interacting among others by looking and finding other players interested in the same game (for example, football, basketball, paintball, etc.), thus creating a team. They will then agree on that certain game and where they will play it.
# Needs
Youth are active and hard workers, but everyone needs a break away from the screen, work, and studying!
In general, they love sports and games, but they usually struggle to find people with the same schedule and same interests to make fields reservations with and to play with.
Gamesity is proposing a platform that offers for youth the potential to meet their peers and the chance to form the perfect team and reservation for the good time to be well spent!
# Target market
Youth in general.
Field games players.
